Layout of latte-dock using two panels, aligned respectively on the left and right bottom, with the first transparent and the second 50% opaque and blurred, so as to copy the panel layout of Liri OS ( https://liri.io/ ) from which I took the logo used to identify the theme with the sole purpose of giving a reference to those who do not know that distro.

The theme uses the mirrored floating space above the docks.

It's still a work-in-progress, aesthetically speaking, but I hope you can already like it in its simplicity.
